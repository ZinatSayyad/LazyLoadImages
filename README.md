# LazyLoadImages
Lazy loading is a technique used to optimize the performance of web pages by delaying the loading of certain elements until they are needed. One common use case for lazy loading is images, as large images can significantly slow down the loading time of a web page. In this guide, we will explore the various approaches to lazy loading images and how to implement them.

What is lazy loading?
Lazy loading is a design pattern that delays the loading of certain elements until they are needed. This technique can significantly improve the performance of web pages, especially those with a large number of images or other heavy assets.
In the context of images, lazy loading means that the images on a web page are only loaded when they are visible on the screen. This can be achieved through a number of different approaches, which we will explore in the following sections.



Why lazy load images? 

There are several reasons why lazy loading images can be beneficial for your website:
•	Improved performance: Large images can significantly slow down the loading time of a web page, especially on mobile devices. By lazy loading images, you can reduce the initial load time and improve the overall performance of your website.
•	Better user experience: Users are more likely to engage with your website if it loads quickly and smoothly. By reducing the loading time of your web pages, you can provide a better user experience and increase engagement.
•	Reduced bandwidth usage: Lazy loading images can also help reduce the amount of bandwidth used by your website, which can be particularly important for users with limited data plans or slow internet connections.


Approaches to lazy loading images

 There are several different approaches to lazy loading images, each with its own advantages and disadvantages , In this repository we will use Intersection Observer
Intersection Observer API The Intersection Observer API is a relatively new web API that allows you to observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport. This API is well-suited for lazy loading images because it allows you to detect when an image is within the viewport and only load it at that point.
